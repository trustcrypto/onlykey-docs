# OpenSSH use with OnlyKey

This document describes how to use the OnlyKey as a second factor authentication device with traditional SSH Keys.

The OnlyKey currently only supports `ecdsa` and `ed25519` keys with OpenSSH.

## Quickstart Guide

1. You must have OpenSSH v8.2 or higher and the necessary [prerequisites](#prerequisites) installed.

2. You may now generate your SSH keys using `ssh-keygen`.  Provide any desired optional arguments and you will be prompted to press your OnlyKey and provide an optional passphrase.

```
$ ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk
You may need to touch your authenticator to authorize key generation.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk
Your public key has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:ECFmaoLZENpq0rLem8HC1F6vTwH1pjsnR6X8l/r54rQ user@host
The key's randomart image is:
+-[ECDSA-SK 256]--+
|o.  + oo         |
|o= + ....        |
|= =. ... o .     |
| =.   ..+ o      |
|+o.. . oS+       |
|=oo . . + .   .  |
|.o +   * o . +   |
|. o o o o = +.o  |
| . +....   .oEo. |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

3. Then copy the new public key to your remote hosts.

```
$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk user@remotehost
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "id_ecdsa_sk.pub"
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'user@remotehost'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
```

4. And then log in your remote host.  You will be prompted to enter your passphrase (if entered during key generation) and asked to press your OnlyKey.

```
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk user@remotehost
Enter passphrase for key 'id_ecdsa_sk':
Confirm user presence for key ECDSA-SK SHA256:ECFmaoLZENpq0rLem8HC1F6vTwH1pjsnR6X8l/r54rQ
```

5. Success!

## FIDO2 Resident Keys

1. OnlyKey firmware v2.1.1 or higher is required to use this feature.

Use the following command to generate a key and store it on the device:

```
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -O resident -f ~/.ssh/id_mykey_sk
```

2. Then copy the new public key to your remote hosts.

3. To view resident keys stored on device use [onlykey-cli](/command-line#list-and-remove-fido2-resident-key)

```
$ onlykey-cli credential ls
PIN: 
Relying Party       Username            Credential ID
-----------------------------------------------------
ssh:                openssh             F6pS8iFTMI9ezUZRMD39pMgC3CMpEwVCq9Y6O8YEc3lNGuMGEOihYhFZYP4ewiPmUpyfS26AIA3LXlwyHIrx4rG/fR67AA==
